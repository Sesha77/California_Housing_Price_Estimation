# boston_house_price_prediction
This project predicts Boston house prices using machine learning. It applies models like Linear Regression and Random Forest on the Boston Housing Dataset, with data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and visualizations for accurate, real-world price prediction.
The primary objective is to build an accurate regression model that can predict house prices based on these features. The project starts with a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data, detect missing values, explore feature correlations, and visualize relationships among variables. Following EDA, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using techniques like normalization, feature scaling, and correlation-based feature selection to improve model performance.

Multiple regression algorithms are implemented and compared in this project, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using common regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) score to assess their predictive accuracy. Visualization techniques such as scatter plots, residual plots, and feature importance graphs are used to analyze the model’s behavior and performance. Among the models tested, the Random Forest Regressor provides the most accurate and robust results due to its ensemble learning approach that reduces overfitting and variance.

The project also includes functionality to save the best-performing model using joblib for future deployment or integration into web applications. Overall, this project showcases the complete lifecycle of a machine learning regression problem—from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and result interpretation. It demonstrates how predictive models can be built using real-world data to support decision-making in the real estate domain. The code is written in Python and makes use of popular libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. This project serves as a practical and educational example of applying machine learning techniques for real-world data science problems.
